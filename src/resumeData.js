During free time throughout his travels, he continued to find excitement in the process of learning the many skills developers must need to know (There's a lot of time when you're sitting on a plane, train or automobile). As an ex-professional athlete, habits like hard work, dedication, and tenacity are not new. Plus now that he's back, Thai is excited to jump head first into a lifelong learning career as a software developer.",
